# basalt-probe

`bin/basalt-probe` starts the engine as a child process (`--serve`, like `basalt-bench`), asks it for the machine's
rates, measures cold decode speed on the three standard fixtures and prints a short report with suggested values. It is
manual: it prints and saves nothing. It is a separate program, not a subcommand of `basalt`.

```
basalt-probe --model PACK.basalt -- ENGINE FLAGS...
```

| option | meaning |
|---|---|
| `--model FILE` | the model file |
| `--engine BIN`, `--fixtures DIR`, `--logs DIR` | as for `basalt-bench` |
| `-- ARGS` | engine flags, as for `basalt-bench` (`--peer-device`, `--kv`, `--spec`, `--expert-cache`, ...). Nothing is added except a `--max-context` that fits the fixtures when none is given: the report prints the flags that produced its numbers |

## What it does

1. Starts the engine and waits for READY.
2. Sends `PROBE rates` ([running](running.md)) and prints the rates as the first report line: each GPU's memory
   copy rate, the host-to-device link rate of the first GPU, and the host read rate at the engine's worker count.
3. Reads the tier placement: the primary GPU's expert slots from the engine's INFO line, the peer's from its log.
4. Runs `conv`, `struct` and `prose` once each, greedy, 400 tokens each, in that order. These are the **cold**
   speeds: the first request after load counts, nothing is discarded, and nothing is repeated.
5. Measures the values it suggests (below).

The token budget is part of what "cold" means: the engine keeps adapting its expert tiers as it decodes, so a longer
request reads faster. The speeds are at the engine's context. The fixtures are short prompts, so they are measured at
the fixture depth with the context allocated, not with the KV filled to it.

## Suggested values

The probe prints `suggested:` lines for values its own measurements say beat the engine's built-in defaults on this
machine. Nothing is applied or saved; a value equal to the default is not printed.

- **`--pool-workers N`**: the CPU expert time per expert (8 experts per call) is measured at 1, 2, 4, ... and every
  pool worker count (`PROBE rates`). The pick is the smallest count within 2% of the best. It is printed only when it
  is below the pool's count, with the cores it frees. Decode with the pick ties the default; the host read rate alone
  saturates earlier and is not used.
- **`--prefill-cpu-share F`**: the engine prefills 8192-token chunks (`PROBE set share=F`, then a one-token request) at
  share 0 (all GPU) and 1 (all CPU); the balance is `t0 / (t0 + t1)`, rounded to 0.05. A chunk at the balance and at the
  default (ABBA) must then be at least 8% faster, because a live chunk carries about 5% of noise; otherwise nothing is
  printed. The share changes which experts the CPU rounds, so it is fixed per machine, never timing-driven at run time.

The engine's `PROBE set workers=K share=F` sets the pool's active worker count and the share for the requests that
follow, between requests; the probe uses it and the engine is stopped afterwards.
