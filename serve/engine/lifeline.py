"""Start the engine so that it ends with the server, however the server ends.

The server's own path is graceful (QUIT, wait, terminate, kill). This is the guarantee behind it for the cases where
none of that runs: SIGKILL, a crash, a closed console, also while the model is still loading.

* Linux: the child gets PR_SET_PDEATHSIG = SIGKILL. The kernel ties the signal to the thread that forked the child,
  not to the process, so every start is made by one long-lived anchor thread; a request thread that starts an engine
  and then finishes would otherwise take the engine down with it.
* Windows: the child joins a job object that kills its members when the last handle closes; the only handle is ours.
* Everywhere: the child gets its own process group, so a terminal Ctrl+C reaches the server only, which then ends
  the engine the clean way.
